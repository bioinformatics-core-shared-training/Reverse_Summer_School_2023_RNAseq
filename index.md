# Introduction to Bulk RNA-seq data analysis

![](images/CRUK_Cambridge_Institute.png)

## Outline

In this workshop, we will introduce analysis of RNA-seq data. This will
include read alignment, quality control, quantification against a reference,
reading the count data into R, performing differential expression analysis, and
gene set testing, with a focus on the DESeq2 analysis workflow. 

For the Makerere Summer School, we will only teach a small part of the full course
as practicals. The full course can be found here:
