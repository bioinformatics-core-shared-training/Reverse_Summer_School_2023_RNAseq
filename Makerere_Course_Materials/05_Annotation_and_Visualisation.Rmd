Before starting this section, we will make sure we have all the relevant objects
from the Differential Expression analysis.

```{r loadData}
ddsObj.interaction <- readRDS("RObjects/DESeqDataSet.interaction.rds")
results.interaction.11 <- readRDS("RObjects/DESeqResults.interaction_d11.rds")
```

# Adding annotation to the DESeq2 results

We have a list of significantly deferentially expressed genes, but the only
annotation we can see is the Ensembl Gene ID, which is not very informative. 

There are a number of ways to add annotation. One method is to do this using a 
Bioconductor annotation package. These packages which are re-built every 
periodically with the latest annotations. These packages are listed on the 
[annotation section](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData) 
of the Bioconductor, and are installed in the same way as regular Bioconductor 
packages. 

An another approach is to use `biomaRt`, an interface to the 
[BioMart](http://www.biomart.org/) resource. Using BioMart ensures that you are 
able to get the latest annotations for the GeneIDs, and can match the version of
the gene annotation that was used for read counting.

A third method is to use `AnnotationHub`, this is like the bioconductor
packages but in an online database like `bioMaRt`. They keep them slightly more
up to date than the standard bioconductor packages and each time you use them
the results are cached on your machine. 

Today we will use the `AnnotationHub` method. A workflow for annotation with
biomaRt is included in the extended materials section accessible on the course
website.

## Query the database

First we need to get the correct database from `AnnotationHub`. We make the
instance (the first time we do this it will create a local cache on your
machine so that repeat queries are very quick). 

As you can see `ah` contains huge amounts of information and it is constantly
changing. This is why it gives us the snapshot date so we know when our cached
version is from. The `ah` object actually online contains pointers to where all
the information is online and we don't want to download all of them as it would
take a very long time and we don't need all of it.

This object is a vector and you can get information about a single resource by
indexing with a single bracket `[` or download a resource with a double bracket
`[[`.

```{r, makeOrgDb, message=F}

# create an annotationhub instance
ah <- AnnotationHub()
ah


# Download the database we want to use
ahQueryResult <- query(ah, c("EnsDb", "Mus musculus", "102"))
ahQueryResult
MouseEnsDb <- ahQueryResult[[1]]

```

This database contains the entire gene annotation from Ensembl release 102 for
mouse. It includes descriptions of genes, transcripts, exons, UTRs etc. 

We can turn the whole gene-level annotation table into a data frame so we can
work with it using the tidyverse suite of tools.

```{r queryOrgDb, message=F}
annotations <- genes(MouseEnsDb, return.type = "data.frame")

# lets see what information we have
colnames(annotations)
```


### Missing annotations

Let's inspect the annotation.

```{r inspectAnnot}
head(annotations)

dim(annotations)
length(unique(annotations$entrezid))
sum(is.na(annotations$entrezid)) # Why are there NAs in the ENTREZID column?
```

Gene/transcript/protein IDs mapping between different databases not always
perfect. 
Although majority of IDs map between databases, small subset may not have
matching ID or may have more than one match. 
This is because feature identification algorithms, naming methodologies and
versions may differ among databases. For instance NCBI and HGNC give same ID
for different gene versions, whereas Ensembl assigned separate IDs for gene
versions. Read interesting discussion on
[biostars](https://www.biostars.org/p/119540/).

There are some Ensembl IDs with no EntrezID. These gene ids has no 
corresponding Entrez ID in the `EnsDb` database package. The 
Ensembl and Entrez databases don't match on a 1:1 level although they have 
started taking steps towards consolidating
[in recent years](https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/mane.html).

## Join the annotation to the differential expression results table

Select the columns we want and rename them.
```{r}
annot <- annotations %>%
  select(GeneID = gene_id, Symbol = symbol, Description = description) %>% 
  distinct()
```

**NOTE**: You may get an error with this command that looks like:

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.error {
   color: red;
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE, class.source="error"}
Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
  unable to find an inherited method for function 'select' for signature '"data.frame"'
```

This is due to the `select` function from **dplyr** (part of **tidyverse**)
being masked by the `select` function from one of the annotation packages. This
will have happened because the annotation package was loaded after the
**tidyverse**. You can either restart your R session and reload the required
packages, this time being sure to load **tidyverse** last, or just use
`dplyr::select` to explicitly use the `select` function from **dplyr**:

```{r maskingSolution, eval = FALSE}
annot <- annotations %>%
  dplyr::select(GeneID = gene_id, Symbol = symbol, Description = description)
```

```{r}
annot.interaction.11 <- results.interaction.11 %>%
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  left_join(annot, by="GeneID")
annot.interaction.11
```


# Visualisation

## P-value histogram

A quick and easy "sanity check" for our DE results is to generate a p-value 
histogram. What we should see is a high bar at `0 - 0.05` and then a roughly
uniform tail to the right of this. There is a nice explanation of other possible
patterns in the histogram and what to do when you see them in [this 
post](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/interpreting-pvalue-histogram/).

```{r pvalHist, fig.align="center"}
hist(annot.interaction.11$pvalue)
```
